# coral-bleaching
In this report, we examine the relationship between coral bleaching, geographic location, and environmental factors such as sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA), and tropical southern atlantic index (TSA). We display the relationship between these variables through visualizations. Additionally, we construct a ML model that predicts coral bleaching percent in a specified area.
